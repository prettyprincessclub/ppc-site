  <h1>Tourist Information</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Las Vegas, NV USA is a tourist wonderland!  While you enjoy Royal Vegas Retreat, the Vegas Strip awaits for all of your needs.</p>
  <p>Visit the <a href="https://mgmgrand.mgmresorts.com/en.html">MGM Grand</a> site to learn more about the amenities available at the venue.</p>
  <p>Throughout this page, we include affiliate links to <a href="//vegas.vdvm.net/c/2017195/267009/4221">Vegas.com</a><img height="0" width="0" src="//vegas.vdvm.net/i/2017195/267009/4221" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />. We really appreciate it when you use these links to book your show tickets, tours, and special experiences - it helps us raise money to make Royal Vegas Retreat the best it can be!</p>
  <h2 class="section-header">Transportation</h2>
  <p>The Vegas Strip is bigger than it looks. Check out our recommendation for getting from one end to the other:</p>
  <h3>Las Vegas Monorail</h3>
  <a id="6592" href="https://vegas.vdvm.net/c/2017195/269629/4221?prodsku=6592&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegas.com%2Fattractions%2Flas-vegas-transportation%2Flas-vegas-monorail%2F"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.vegas.com/media/vegas/tours/las-vegas-transportation/las-vegas-monorail/tours_lvmonorail-2014.jpg" border="0" alt="Las Vegas Monorail"/></a>
  <p>In our opinion, there's no better way to get around the strip than the <a id="6592" href="https://vegas.vdvm.net/c/2017195/269629/4221?prodsku=6592&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegas.com%2Fattractions%2Flas-vegas-transportation%2Flas-vegas-monorail%2F">Las Vegas Monorail!</a></p>
  <p><i>Travel the Strip without all the walking on a fast, convenient monorail trip. The Las Vegas Monorail, an elevated train system that travels along a 3.9-mile route, connects major hotels and attractions along the Las Vegas Strip. The train stops are located at the back of each hotel, making the walk 15 minutes or less within each resort. Trains arrive every few minutes, so you’re quickly connected to world-class resorts, hotel and casinos, shops, restaurants, entertainment venues and the Las Vegas Convention Center.</i></p>

  <p><i>America's favorite faceless dance crew is back. Jabbawockeez rose to fame on "Americas Best Dance Crew" and has since captivated audiences and the dance community with its unique style. In white masks and gloves, the Jabbawockeez direct audience members' attention away from their individual identities to emphasize the dancers' unity and to create visual representations of music. Jabbawockeez was the first dance crew to headline on the Las Vegas Strip. Their show "MÜS.I.C." premiered at the MGM Grand in 2010. They have since performed at the Monte Carlo and Luxor. <a id="3970" href="https://vegas.vdvm.net/c/2017195/269518/4221?prodsku=3970&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vegas.com%2Fshows%2Fdance%2Fjabbawockeez-las-vegas%2F">They are now returning to the MGM Grand for an unforgettable show.</a></i></p>

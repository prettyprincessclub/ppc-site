  <h2>Kuroshiro Kawaii</h2>

  <img src="../images/guests/KSKLogo_PROFILE.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Kuroshiro Kawaii logo"/>
</div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
  <p>Kuroshiro Kawaii is a brand that wants to ensure that the entire community in the Houston, TX area has access to quality Japanese fashion. They pride themselves on having real connections to brand owners and designers, including Japanese, indie, and self-care brands.</p>
  <p>Kuroshiro Kawaii is a name with multiple facets. When they were deciding on a name, they wanted one that would reflect the duality of the fashions they offer while at the same time being recognizable and inviting to the typical American in the area.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">
  <p>The “kuro” in their name stands for punk, gothic, and visual fashion; while “shiro” stands for elegant, princely, and sweet lolita and ouji fashions. It also reflects another duality that is important to the attitude of their shop: good and evil, angel and devil, order and chaos. The words “kuro” and “shiro,” and their associated meaning in kanji, really pin down what they wanted for the look and feel of their shop and the brands they want to carry.</p>
  <p>“Kawaii” is a word commonly known and familiar to most Americans, and reflects a large portion of the styles they will carry: kawaii and Harajuku styles.</p>
  <p>You can buy from Kuroshiro Kawaii on their webshop: <a href="https://kskawaii.com/">https://kskawaii.com/</a>. You can also follow them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kuroshirokawaii/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kskawaiishop/">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/KSKawaiiShop">Twitter</a>.</p>

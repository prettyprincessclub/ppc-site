  <h1>RVR Programming</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>We are postponing our event to November 2021, and as such, we will be reworking our schedule and planned content. We anticipate that most of our planned programming will stay the same as our 2020 lineup. Stay tuned for updates in early 2021.</p>
  <!--<p>We're planning an incredible event stacked with fashion shows, a tea party, EGL trivia, games, panels, and shopping.</p>
  <p>We will release more information about official event programming in 2020, including special guest panels and VIP events.</p>
  <p>Applications for models and coordinate contest entrants will open in August 2020.</p>
  <p>Check out our tentative schedule below - subject to change prior to event.</p>
  <h2 class="section-header">Before the Event</h2>
  <h4>VIP Badge Pickup</h4>
  <p>Calling all VIPs! Arrive Thursday, the day before the main event starts, to pick up your badge before everyone else. Get settled in and start the party!</p>
  <p><b>VIP Perk:</b> Early badge pickup is open to VIPs, special guests, and staff only.</p>
  <h2 class="section-header">Day 1</h2>
  <h3 class="section-header">Friday, November 20 2020</h3>
  <h4>VIP Mixer</h4>
  <p>Calling all VIPs! Get your pre-funk on bright and early on Friday for an exclusive mixer. Meet your fellow VIPs, get your bearings, and relax before the main content starts.</p>

  <h4>Scavenger Hunt</h4>
  <p>Want to meet new people and make friends? Looking for a way to strike up conversation? Pick up your scavenger hunt sheet as soon as the convention opens. Complete your scavenger hunt by finding a different attendee who meets each criterion: from a given state, wearing a specific print, etc. - and have them sign their name when you find them. If you complete your sheet, you may hand it in to RVR staff at any time, and we will enter you in a raffle for a fabulous prize. We will announce the winner at the closing remarks.</p>
  <h4>Fashion Shows</h4>
  <p>All Friday and Saturday afternoon, our brands, sponsors, and special guests will show off their newest and best collections on the runway. See their looks - then head to the vendors' room to buy them!</p>
  <p><b>VIP Perk:</b> VIPs will have priority seating at this event.</p>
  <p>Interested in modeling at the fashion show? Applications will open August 2020.</p>
  <p>The schedule of designers and brands at the fashion show will be released October 2020.</p>
  <h4>Coord Contest - Novice</h4>
  <p>Thinking about trying your hand at a coord contest? Want to bring your coording skills to the next level? If you've never won a coord contest before, the Novice Coord Contest is for you! Show off your best Lolita fashion outfit in any substyle.</p> 
  <p>Judges and prizes to be announced.</p>
  <p><b>VIP Perk:</b> VIPs will have priority seating at this event.</p>
  <p>Interested in Ouji fashion? Consider entering our Ouji coord contest instead.</p>

  <h4>Coord Contest - Handmade</h4>
  <p>Are you a talented sewist who regularly makes their own coords? Wear your best handmade outfit - by which we mean all main pieces (dresses, blouses, skirts, trousers, vests, etc.) must be handmade by you! Entrants are not required to make their own shoes, socks, accessories, or jewelry, but we strongly encourage you to show off as much of your handiwork as possible!</p>
  <p>Judges and prizes to be announced.</p>

Are you the kind of person who likes to do a little casual soldering in preparation for a big event? The master coord contest is for you!</p>
  <p>If you have ever won a coordinate contest in the past (use your best judgment) - enter the master contest, not the novice contest.</p>

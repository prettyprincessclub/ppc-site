  <p>Yes! We have set aside rooms for Thursday, November 18 and Sunday, November 21 (to check out Monday, November 22). We highly encourage you to come in early to get your bearings and stay late for a relaxing trip home! We still hope to plan pre- and post-convention informal events for VIPs and GA ticketholders, but our content schedule is subject to change as a result of COVID-19.</p>
  <h3 class="section-header">Registration</h3>
  <p>See also <a href="./reg.html">our main registration page</a>.</p>
  <h4>Where do I buy my ticket?</h4>
  <p>Please see our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ppc-presents-royal-vegas-retreat-2020-tickets-52897344381">Eventbrite page</a> to purchase your ticket once sales open on June 26, 2021.</p>
  <h4>How will ticket sales work in 2021?</h4>
  <p>Ticket reservations will open on <b>June 26th at 12:00 PM PT</b>. At this time, you will be able to <b>reserve your GA or VIP ticket</b> on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ppc-presents-royal-vegas-retreat-2021-tickets-52897344381">our Eventbrite page</a>. (Our Eventbrite page still shows us as postponed right now - don't worry! We will be making updates behind the scenes to prepare for ticket sales.)</p>
  <p><b>GA tickets</b> will cost <b>$5</b> to reserve. <b>VIP tickets</b> will cost <b>$20</b> to reserve. Only GA and VIP tickets will be available during the reservation period.</p>
  <p>The reservation period ends <b>July 31st or when we sell out of tickets</b>.</p>
  <p>On <b>August 14th</b> we will ask everyone who reserved a ticket during the reservation period to pay the remainder of their ticket price. At this time, you will pay the remaining <b>$120</b> for <b>GA tickets</b> and <b>$180</b> for <b>VIP tickets</b>.</p> 
  <p>In addition, if any tickets remain after the reservation period, or if we are able to increase our attendance cap, we will offer <b>GA, VIP, and Limited-Access Partner Pass tickets</b> at full price. Prices are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><b>GA</b>: $125</li>
      <li><b>VIP</b>: $200</li>
      <li><b>Partner Pass</b>: $20</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>We are no longer offering Sunday-only tickets. The Partner Pass is a special ticket type for partners of attendees who do not wear J-fashion. Partner Pass ticketholders are not required to adhere to the dress code. However, they may only access the vendors' area and fashion show content.</p>
  <h4>Why do I have to reserve a ticket first? Why is the process for buying a ticket different?</h4>
  <p>We are offering this reserve option to help mitigate the risk involved in committing to an event while the global pandemic is ongoing. In the event that we cannot hold our event safely, those who reserved a ticket in 2021 will be refunded. In the interim, we only require you to put down a minimal down payment.</p>
  <h4>I bought a ticket in 2020. Is it still good for 2021?</h4>
  <p>Yes! All tickets purchased in 2020 have automatically been rolled over to 2021. However, you will need to rebook your room onsite using our <a href="https://book.passkey.com/go/sroy1121mg">Passkey portal</a>.</p>
  <h4>What are the perks associated with VIP tickets?</h4>
  <p>VIP ticketholders get a premium goody bag with gifts from our sponsors, access to exclusive before- and after-parties, and priority seating for afternoon tea and all content. We will provide specific details in the coming months as we get closer to our event. The remaining VIP tickets are in very short supply, so set an alarm if you want one!</p>
  <h4>I have a discount code for a ticket. When can I use it?</h4>
  <p>You can use a discount code to buy your ticket anytime while full-price ticket sales are open. You cannot use your discount code on ticket reservations.</p>
  <h4>Will you sell single-day tickets?</h4>
  <p>At this time we do not plan to sell single-day tickets.</p>
  <h4>Will you sell tickets at the event?</h4>
  <p>At this time to we do not plan to sell tickets at the event.</p>
  <h4>I tried to use a discount code to buy my ticket, but it didn't work! What do I do?</h4>
  <p>Oh no! <a href="../contact.html">Contact us</a> right away, and provide a picture of your promo code. We will fix it ASAP!</p>
  <h4>I bought a ticket, but it turns out I can't go to Royal Vegas Retreat. Can I get a refund?</h4>
  <p>We will allow refunds, no questions asked, between October 16 and November 17 2021. This is to allow attendees to make a safe choice regarding their attendance this year.</p>
  <h4>I have a discount code for a ticket, but I won't be able to go to Royal Vegas Retreat. Can I give the ticket to a friend?</h4>
  <p>Yes! As long as you haven't already used your code to buy a ticket, you can gift it to a friend.</p>
  <h4>Do I need a VIP ticket to attend the Sunday afternoon tea party?</h4>
  <p>No! The tea party is included with all GA and VIP tickets by default.</p>
  <h3 class="section-header">Dress Code Policy</h3>
  <h4>What is the dress code policy for Royal Vegas Retreat 2021?</h4>
  <p>Our dress code for Royal Vegas Retreat 2021 is as follows:</p>
  <p>Attendees must wear J-fashion to participate at the event.  This includes but is not limited to: Lolita/EGL, Ouji, Aristocrat/EGA, Mori-kei, Fairy-kei, Decora, Visual-kei, Otome, Gyaru, J-Punk, J-Goth.  Japanese as well as Western formalwear (e.g. a three-piece suit) are also allowed.</p>
  <p>Cosplay, steampunk, and European historical re-enactment costumes do not fit the theme of this event, and as such are not allowed.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about the dress code, please feel free to <a href="../contact.html">contact us</a> with any questions.  Our staff at the event are happy to assist as well, and they will have the final say when considering whether a guest’s attire is appropriate for the event.</p>
  <h4>What if my non-Lolita partner or parent wants to come to Royal Vegas Retreat?</h4>
  <p>All J-fashion complies with our dress code, as well as general formalwear - you don't have to wear Lolita all weekend long, and neither does your companion.</p>
  <p>But if your travel buddy doesn't want to dress up, we have a special limited-access Partner Pass. The Partner Pass allows your partner to attend the fashion shows and shop in the vendors' room for a discounted price and no dress code requirement. The Partner Pass does not include access to panels, tea party, dance, games, coord contests, or any other part of the event outside of the fashion shows and vendors' room.</p>
  <h3 class="section-header">Accessibility</h3>
  <h4>I have dietary restrictions. Will I still be able to enjoy the Sunday afternoon tea party?</h4>
  <p>Yes! We will ask you for your dietary restrictions via Eventbrite when you purchase your ticket.</p>

  <p>Yes! The MGM Grand offers mobility scooters for rent, but you'll have to call ahead to reserve one - see the MGM Grand contact information here: <a href="https://mgmgrand.mgmresorts.com/en/contact-us.html">https://mgmgrand.mgmresorts.com/en/contact-us.html</a></p>

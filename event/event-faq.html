  <h4>What is the dress code policy for Royal Vegas Retreat 2021?</h4>
  <p>Our dress code for Royal Vegas Retreat 2021 is as follows:</p>
  <p>Attendees must wear J-fashion to participate at the event.  This includes but is not limited to: Lolita/EGL, Ouji, Aristocrat/EGA, Mori-kei, Fairy-kei, Decora, Visual-kei, Otome, Gyaru, J-Punk, J-Goth.  Japanese as well as Western formalwear (e.g. a three-piece suit) are also allowed.</p>
  <p>Cosplay, steampunk, and European historical re-enactment costumes do not fit the theme of this event, and as such are not allowed.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about the dress code, please feel free to <a href="../contact.html">contact us</a> with any questions.  Our staff at the event are happy to assist as well, and they will have the final say when considering whether a guestâ€™s attire is appropriate for the event.</p>
  <h4>What if my non-Lolita partner or parent wants to come to Royal Vegas Retreat?</h4>
  <p>All J-fashion complies with our dress code, as well as general formalwear - you don't have to wear Lolita all weekend long, and neither does your companion.</p>
  <p>But if your travel buddy doesn't want to dress up, we have a special limited-access Partner Pass. The Partner Pass allows your partner to attend the fashion shows and shop in the vendors' room for a discounted price and no dress code requirement. The Partner Pass does not include access to panels, tea party, dance, games, coord contests, or any other part of the event outside of the fashion shows and vendors' room.</p>

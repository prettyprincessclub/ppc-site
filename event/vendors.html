<p>Hello this is Christina, the creator behind Kittykaya! Kittykaya’s apparel features my own original artwork based on lolita fashion and kawaii culture. I’ve been around awhile and I found it was difficult to wear lolita every day. Now that I’ve started a family of my own I needed more comfortable looks that still filled my lolita heart. My clothing bridges the gap between comfy and cute!</p>
<p>I make my headbows on clips for all day wear or even for stacking in comfort. I sew plus size friendly dresses with custom sizing available, full back shirring, and they come with pockets! My full print tees, tights, leggings size up to 3XL. And my zipper tote bags are super roomy to hold all the things that won’t fit in your adorable but tiny Usakumyas.</p>

  <div class="col-md-8">
  <p>Hey, all! We at Kuroshiro Kawaii want to ensure that the entire community in the Houston, TX area has access to quality Japanese fashion. We pride ourselves on having real connections to brand owners and designers, including Japanese, indie, and self-care brands. Kuroshiro Kawaii—it’s a name with multiple facets. When we were deciding on a name, we wanted one that would reflect the duality of the fashions we offer while at the same time being recognizable and inviting to the typical American in the area. The “kuro” in our name stands for punk, gothic, and visual fashion; while “shiro” stands for elegant, princely, and sweet lolita and ouji fashions. It also reflects another duality that is important to the attitude of our shop: good and evil, angel and devil, order and chaos. The words “kuro” and “shiro,” and their associated meaning in kanji, really pin down what we wanted for the look and feel of our shop and the brands we want to carry. </p>

  <h2><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/HoliLoliEGL">Holi Loli</a></h2>
  <p>I’m a designer/maker that fell in love with Lolita in 2004- the lovely shape of classic pieces really spoke to me. I started creating soon after, and offer underskirts and accessories on my Etsy!  Though my main influences are classic and gothic, lot of my inspiration comes from Indian fashion. The name, Holi Loli, is a reference to the festival of colours, and this is reflected in my designs. I’m planning to release a print soon featuring a combination of Indian and Gothic. I’ve already started on it and am hoping to have it ready for the event! See you there!</p>

  <h2><a href="https://kskawaii.com/">Kuroshiro Kawaii</a></h2>
  <p>Hey, all! We at Kuroshiro Kawaii want to ensure that the entire community in the Houston, TX area has access to quality Japanese fashion. We pride ourselves on having real connections to brand owners and designers, including Japanese, indie, and self-care brands. Kuroshiro Kawaii—it’s a name with multiple facets. When we were deciding on a name, we wanted one that would reflect the duality of the fashions we offer while at the same time being recognizable and inviting to the typical American in the area. The “kuro” in our name stands for punk, gothic, and visual fashion; while “shiro” stands for elegant, princely, and sweet lolita and ouji fashions. It also reflects another duality that is important to the attitude of our shop: good and evil, angel and devil, order and chaos. The words “kuro” and “shiro,” and their associated meaning in kanji, really pin down what we wanted for the look and feel of our shop and the brands we want to carry. </p>
  <h2><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lavendorium">Lavendorium</a></h2>

Every single one is created to become a treasured part of someone's beloved wardrobe! The items you'll find here are sometimes spooky, sometimes sweet, but always sparkly! </p>
  <h2><a href="lief.co.kr">Lief</a></h2>
  <p>Lief, which means both cute and lovely in Dutch, has a touch of Gothic and a pinch of sweetness, allowing us to create lovely, classical styles that can be worn in both casual and elegant situations.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://oddmonster.co/">Odd Monster</a></h2>
  <p>25% of the profits from the event will be donated to the Equal Justice Initiative</p>
  <p>Odd Monster is inspired largely by 80's/90's pop culture, Japanese street fashion, as well as a dash of trashy horror and occult. Odd Monster is a slow fashion company: each piece is sewn, printed and/or embellished by hand by the designer herself, while material is sourced through local companies whenever possible. The goal is to create something a little bit cute, a little bit nerdy, and a little bit odd for all the other fashionable weirdos out there.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ParadiseRose">Paradise Rose Shop</a></h2>
  <p>The idea behind Paradise Rose is to provide those who love Japanese fashion with handmade, affordable jewelry and accessories that compliment your wardrobe and complete the outfit.

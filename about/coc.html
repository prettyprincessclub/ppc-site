    <h1>Code of Conduct and Policies</h1>


</div>

<div class="row content">
<p>Royal Vegas Retreat and all Pretty Princess Club events strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for fashion enthusiasts to share their love for Lolita Fashion and J-Fashion.</p>
<p>All attendees must be 13 or older to purchase a ticket to Royal Vegas Retreat. Attendees must be over 21 to consume alcohol at RVR.</p>
<p>For our 2021 event, all attendees MUST be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, where "fully vaccinated" means it has been at least 2 weeks since an attendee's final dose of vaccine. All attendees MUST show proof of vaccination in order to pick up their badge. Anyone caught falsifying their proof of vaccination will be ejected from the event with no refund. Attendees must wear a mask at all times when not eating or drinking. Attendees with masks down or off will be reminded to put their mask back on. Failure to comply may result in ejection from the event with no refund. Pretty Princess Club will provide KN-95 masks for any attendee who needs one.</p>
<p>Pretty Princess Club stands in opposition to white supremacy, white nationalism, the alt-right, and fascism. We stand in solidarity with all marginalized fashion fans, especially Black and Indigenous fashion fans and, broadly, all fashion fans of color, and trans, fat and plus-sized, and disabled fashion fans. Fashion is not an escape until it is an escape for everyone, and we will do everything we can in our role as an event provider to improve the Lolita Fashion community.</p>
<p>(This section was edited on October 14, 2021 for clarity) No attendee may wear a coordinate or piece that uses nazi, fascist, or alt-right aesthetics or symbols. In addition, no attendee may wear items intended to mock or appropriate from marginalized people and cultures. Attendees wearing such coordinates will be ejected from the event immediately with no refund and banned from future events both in-person and online.</p>
<p>Pretty Princess Club will not tolerate harassment of any kind at any PPC event, including but not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>stalking, intimidation or bullying</li>
<li>offensive comments</li> 
<li>physical harassment or unwelcome physical attention</li> 
<li>non-consensual recording or photography</li>
<li>and the use of any hate-related image, symbol, or speech concerning an attendee's race or ethnicity, gender identity or expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, or religion.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Pretty Princess Club will take immediate action against any attendee who harasses another, including expulsion from the event with no refund and banning the harasser from future events. All people present at any PPC event are subject to this policy, including vendors, special guests, staff, and volunteers. We will center the needs of the person being harassed and work to provide space and comfort after removing the harasser from the situation. We will never directly escalate to law enforcement, as this compromises the safety of our guests.</p>
<p>PPC proactively bans known harassers, predators, and bigots from our events. If you are a community moderator in the United States, we invite you to share any ban lists or information you may have to make our events safer. Please email us directly at <a href="mailto:info@prettyprincess.club">info@prettyprincess.club</a>. We will not share anything you tell us with outside parties, unless you give us permission to do so.</p>
<p>PPC understands that certain fashion accessories, such as collar-style necklaces and harnesses, become part of our fashion despite their relationship to kink. While collar-style necklaces and harnesses are permitted to be worn and sold, the following items may NOT be worn or sold at any PPC event:</p>
<ul>
<li>rope</li>
<li>impact toys such as crops, floggers, or whips</li>
<li>any sex toys</li>
<li>any accessory with an obvious sexual purpose beyond fashion</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees will be asked to put these items away if shown, and refusal to do so will be interpreted as harassment.</p>
<p>Please see our <a href="./photo-release.html">Photo Release page</a> to understand how your image or likeness will be used by PPC if you attend an in-person event.</p>
<p>PPC is committed to providing an accessible experience at large events by</p> 
<ul>
<li>working with ADA-compliant venues</li>
<li>providing maps with accessible modes of transport across the venue</li>
<li>providing seating in queueing areas</li> 
<li>providing meals in line with attendees' dietary restrictions</li>
<li>providing extra seating at dances and concerts</li>
</ul> 
<p>If you require specific accommodations in order to attend an event, please reach out to us directly at <a href="mailto:info@prettyprincess.club">info@prettyprincess.club</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty Princess Club, its staff, and its partners are not responsible for any loss, damage, theft, or injury. Event attendees, virtual and in-person, are responsible for their individual actions and any repercussions that may result. Civil or medical emergencies are to be handled directly by the proper authorities.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our code of conduct and policies, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@prettyprincess.club">info@prettyprincess.club</a></p>
<h2>Social Media Policies</h2>
<p>Social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or any other platform, that are explicitly for the purposes of fetish play or promoting kink culture, especially DDLG and ABDL, may not follow any Pretty Princess Club social media account. This is for the safety of our followers and to ensure that our accounts don't become desirable targets for fetish mining. Any fetish account that follows us will be blocked. If you happen to notice a fetish account in our followers, please let us know via DM or email us directly at <a href="mailto:info@prettyprincess.club">info@prettyprincess.club</a>.</p>
<p>We ask that, when commenting on our posts on any platform, you engage in good faith at all times. Any comment interpreted as harrassment or trolling may be removed with no explanation, and the account providing the comment may be blocked.</p>
<h2>Staff and Volunteer Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>This section goes into effect starting January 1, 2022.</p>
<p>We expect our staff and volunteers to act with a high degree of professionalism at all times. As de-facto representatives of PPC, staff and volunteers must uphold our values. Staff and volunteers who break our code of conduct, including any part of our general code of conduct, will not only be subject to any consequences outlined in the code of conduct, but also will not work as a staff member or volunteer at any future PPC event.</p>
<h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Treat all guests like they belong. Lolita and J-fashion have a reputation for being exclusive, so putting on an event for the community means making all of our guests feel welcome.</li>
<li>Be professional. While on shift as a volunteer, or when representing Pretty Princess Club in an official capacity, you must act professionally. While many of us feel like we’re among friends and people we know while volunteering at RVR, not all of our guests are as established in the community. Refrain from making inside jokes or comments that guests will find insulting without the proper context.</li>
<li>Ask everyone. When requesting proof of ID or for a guest to show their badge, you must ask everyone in their group. Failure to do so risks singling someone out, who may already feel unwelcome in the J-fashion community because of their race, gender identity, or age.</li>
<li>Be direct. Avoid miscommunications by saying exactly what you mean, when you need to say it. “Can I see your badge?” is always better than whispering to another person to ask if they know the guest in question.</li>
<li>Be accountable. We all make mistakes. When you mess up, for example, if you use the wrong pronouns for a guest, apologize briefly and sincerely and move on. Be on time for your shifts and be prepared to cover for each other when needed.</li></ul></p>
<h3>Basic Expectations</h3>
<p>We will revise these expectations to align with those of other events and to be as specific as is reasonable in 2022. These are a starting point for what PPC expects of all volunteers and staff.</p>
<p>Volunteers must
  <ul>
  <li>Attend any training meetings held online prior to the event</li>
<li>Read the code of conduct in full and attest that they have read it</li>
<li>Show up on time for 100% of their shifts, or find someone who can cover for them</li>
<li>Escalate to the appropriate staff member in case of emergency or conflict</li>
<li>Treat all attendees, regardless of role at the event, with respect</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Staff must
<ul>
<li>Attend staff meetings when held, or follow up on meetings when they cannot attend by reading the notes and asking questions</li>
<li>Fulfill 100% of their commitments at the event</li>
<li>Fulfill 100% of their commitments before and after the event, including time-sensitive event prep</li>
<li>Read the code of conduct in full</li>
<li>Escalate to the appropriate staff member or venue point of contact in case of emergency or conflict</li>
<li>Treat all attendees, regardless of role at the event, with respect</li>
</ul></p>

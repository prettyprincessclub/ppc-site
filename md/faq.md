Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Pretty Princess Club, LLC
-------------------------

### What's with the name?

It's definitely a bit of internet snark that appealed to Nifty Nif, PPC, LLC HBIC. Nif also loves modern TLDs, and princess.club was a lot more expensive. Coincidentally, Pretty Princess Club was available for registration in Nifty Nif's home state.

### Who is PPC?

PPC is an LLC registered in Washington State, USA. It consists of one member, Nifty Nif.

### What else do you do?

Nifty is a software engineer by day. She also likes to play pinball, cook and bake, watch cartoons, and make costumes.

### What else does PPC do?

That remains to be seen! We incorporated in order to put on the [Royal Vegas Retreat](./vegas.html). Perhaps someday, pending the success of RVR, PPC will expand and help other Lolitas put on events.

EGL Fashion
-----------

### What is EGL?

EGL is short for "Elegant Gothic Lolita." "Lolita Fashion" is another name for it. It's a style of dress that originated in Japan and is associated with Harajuku fashion culture.
